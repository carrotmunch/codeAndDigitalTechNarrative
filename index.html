  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Kamron. I come from a small town in York, PA. Currently, I am living and studying for a computer science degree at the University of Pittsburgh. Early in my life, technology wasn’t as important to me as it is now. However, when I was younger, I always had a fascination with tech. In middle school, we were given iPads to do some school work, and ever since then, I feel like I’ve had a sort of attachment to technology. Coding with a block-based program was one of the first things I’ve done with technology, and it made me fall in love with the concept. Ever since then, my infatuation with programming and technology has only grown.

<!--Conduct your own Dear Data inquiry…collecting, analyzing, and communicating data (Shout out to Dear Data authors Georgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec). Use your built-in screen time monitoring features on your phone, tablet, and computer to assist you in tracking your technology use over 5-7 days. Then create a data visualization using colored pencils, crayons, or markers that tells the story of you and your data. Here's our framing question “How do you interact with technology and in what ways? (frequency and distribution of various activities.) For example: What apps get you through your day, what kinds of media are you consuming, what kinds of websites are you using?-->
<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Everyday Code</h2>
    <p>
      I think that code has a much larger impact on how we think, do, and move through the world than more people think. A large majority of people will go through life never learning or looking past the frontend of code and taking it for granted. In this technological age, code is an essential part of everyone's lives. We use it on our phones every day, whether we think about it or not. During the time of the Data Visualization Activity, I learned a few things about my habits with technology. I feel that I used my phone less because I knew that I was tracking my usage. However, I still feel like once I laid out my times, I was using my phone for way longer than I thought I actually was. The amount of time technology was taking up in my day was unknown to me until this assignment, and it was a little eye-opening. I also feel like there are certain things that it got wrong. Sometimes I would leave my phone open, and it would track that time, even though I wasn't actively using it. Another very important thing to mention is music. Music is a very big part of my life. I love listening to music, and I do every day, for a lot of time every day. However, because my phone usually stays off and is not "open" with the music app, that time doesn't show in my overall usage. That causes a large amount of time I'm using technology to be unaccounted for. I think that this assignment helped create visual representations of our daily use of code, and brings into question how intrusive or helpful this time really is.

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Code and digital technology impact on education</h2>
    <p>Code and technology have undeniably and fundamentally changed the topics and ways that we learn. The current digital age has uprooted many traditional learning styles in favor of adapting to this ever-changing environment. It’s important to recognize how impactful technology has become in the world and to understand that having a basic education in code and computer science should become the standard. It is often understated how important basic education can be, especially considering how much technology is used.

<!--Let's think a little about what we have learned and how we can apply this knowledge and skills moving forward.-->
<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Moving forward with technology</h2>
    <p>After reading through The Singularity is Near, we read about Kurzweil's definition of the singularity. He defines it as a future period of time marked by unprecedented and rapid technological advances that will irreversibly change the way we live. He also goes into detail about how the progression of technology is on an exponential rise, rather than a linear one. I think that many people often underestimate how rapidly technology will increase, often thinking of it linearly as a way to simplify or grasp the concept. I agree with what Kurzweil has to say about the progression, but I disagree with it fundamentally changing what it means to be human and exceeding biological limits. I believe that recognizing the speedy growth and being aware of it, while not letting it become so large that technology is rewriting biology and changing humanity's role in the future. If we become too dependent on technology in the future without any checks and balances in place, it can lead to an unpleasant future, rather than one where humans and tech work in harmony.</p>
